If you make any useful changes or additions to the infrastructure code that can
benefit future projects, maybe those should be ported back to html5-skeleton!

Add all features to backport to the list below, so you don't forget:
- scripts/compile
- tests/index.html
- SignalTest/Signal
- Graphics: Make orientation explicit. The current skeleton code relies on the
  default value, which makes it harder to modify once an orientation is needed.
- Logic: Move entities and components out into separate modules. At least add
  a prefix to the entity ids.
- Main: Move the image path array at the top into its own variable.
- Use two different images for the two objects.
