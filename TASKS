Base code improvements:

- Don't add the canvas to the HTML. Just add a div and create the canvas in
  code. This has two advantages:
  * Currently, with the black background, the fallback text is not correctly
    displayed. If the canvas (and its style information) were generated at
    runtime, this wouldn't be a problem.
  * Using a div would allow for choosing alternative rendering methods at
    runtime.
