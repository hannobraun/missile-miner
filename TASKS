Skeleton improvements:

- Collect some performance metrics:
  * Time it takes to finish a frame (average and standard deviation).
  * Time it takes to finish parts of a frame (average and standard deviation).
- Don't generate any garbage in Graphics and check if that makes any difference
  for performance (especially standard deviation).
- Tie score to amount of ore mined. Currently, there's duplication in the
  calculation.
- Add geometry package that can do some more advanced stuff, like:
  * Computing the direction a vector points to (as angle).
  * Computing the angle between two vectors.
  * Computing the angular direction in which one vector lies relative to
    another.
  * As well as other functionality as it's needed.
