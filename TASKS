Base code improvements:

- Don't add the canvas to the HTML. Just add a div and create the canvas in
  code. This has two advantages:
  * Currently, with the black background, the fallback text is not correctly
    displayed. If the canvas (and its style information) were generated at
    runtime, this wouldn't be a problem.
  * Using a div would allow for choosing alternative rendering methods at
    runtime.
- Add CLI tool that can:
  * Create a new component from a template (./create component Body [Bodies]).
  * Create a new entity from a template (./create entity Miner [Miners]).
- Collect some performance metrics:
  * Time it takes to finish a frame (average and standard deviation).
  * Time it takes to finish parts of a frame (average and standard deviation).
- Don't generate any garbage in Graphics and check if that makes any difference
  for performance (especially standard deviation).
